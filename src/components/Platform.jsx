        Our APIs keep identity, voting, and compliance data in sync. Automate audits, trigger alerts,
        and orchestrate workflows with OpenClaw-style monitoring that surfaces drift before it becomes a
        risk. The platform ships with ready-made guards for ballot integrity and identity lifecycle.
